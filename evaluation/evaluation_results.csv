Pediatricians are doctors who specialize in caring for infants, children, and adolescents. They're trained to diagnose and treat a wide range of conditions, including asthma.

Childhood asthma is a common chronic disease that affects kids, often starting before age 5. It causes inflammation and narrowing of the airways, leading to symptoms like wheezing, coughing, and chest tightness. Asthma can be triggered by various factors such as allergens (like dust mites or pollen), non-allergen triggers (such as cold air or exercise), or a combination of these.

To diagnose asthma in children, healthcare providers use tools like physical exams, medical history, chest x-rays, lung function tests, allergy skin or blood tests, and sometimes a trial of asthma medicines if the child is too young to perform lung function tests. If your child has asthma, you'll work with their healthcare provider to create a treatment plan that may include quick-relief medications for immediate symptom relief and controller medications to reduce inflammation over time.

It's essential to follow the prescribed treatment plan to manage your child's asthma effectively and minimize missed school days or hospitalizations. With proper management, children with asthma can live active, healthy lives. Here are some pediatricians you might want to consider:

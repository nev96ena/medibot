What is radiation therapy? Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment. It uses high doses of radiation to kill cancer cells and stop them from spreading. It may also be used for easing cancer symptoms. Radiation therapy may damage healthy cells. They can usually repair themselves more easily than cancer cells. You may need days or weeks of treatment before the radiation starts killing cancer cells. But cancer cells should keep dying for weeks or months after your treatment ends. When is radiation therapy used for cancer treatment? Radiation therapy treats many types of cancer. It may be used at different times or for different reasons during your treatment. Sometimes radiation is used with other treatments, like surgery, chemotherapy , or immunotherapy .

If you have diabetes , your blood glucose, or blood sugar , levels are too high.  Over time, this can damage the covering on your nerves or the blood vessels that bring oxygen to your nerves. Damaged nerves may stop sending messages, or may send messages slowly or at the wrong times. This damage is called diabetic neuropathy.  Over half of people with diabetes get it.

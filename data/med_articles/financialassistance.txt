Health care can be costly. If you have health insurance , it usually pays at least part of your medical costs. If you don't have insurance or need help with costs that aren't covered, financial assistance might 
be available. Certain government programs and nonprofit organizations can help. You can also discuss 
concerns about paying your medical bills with your health care provider, social worker or the business 
office of your clinic or hospital.

Organs you can donate include: Internal organs: Kidneys, heart, liver, pancreas, intestines, lungs Skin Bone and bone marrow Cornea Most organ and tissue donations occur after the donor has died. But some organs and tissues can be donated while the donor is alive. People of all ages and background can be organ donors. If you are under age 18, your parent or guardian must give you permission to become a donor. If you are 18 or older you can show you want to be a donor by signing a donor card. You should also let your family know your wishes. Health Resources and Services Administration

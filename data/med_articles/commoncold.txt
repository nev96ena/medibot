More than 200 different viruses can cause a cold, but rhinoviruses are the most common type. The viruses that cause colds are very contagious. They can spread from person to person through the air and close personal contact. You can also get infected when you touch something that has the virus on it and then touch your eyes, mouth, or nose. For example, you could get a cold after you shake hands with someone who has a cold or touch a doorknob that has the germs on it, and then touch your face. What are the symptoms of the common cold? The symptoms of a common cold usually include: Sneezing Stuffy nose (congestion) Runny nose Sore throat Coughing Headache The symptoms usually start a few days after you become infected with the virus.

Using a clean humidifier or cool mist vaporizer. Gargling with warm salt water. Using saline nose drops or sprays. Taking over-the-counter pain or cold and cough medicines . But you need to be careful with certain medicines: Children and teens should not take aspirin. Some cold and cough medicines contain ingredients that are not recommended for children. Talk with your child's health care provider before giving your child any cold and cough medicines. Some cold and cough medicines contain pain relievers.

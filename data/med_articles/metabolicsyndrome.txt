Triglycerides are a type of fat found in the blood. Having a low HDL cholesterol level . HDL is sometimes called the "good" cholesterol because it helps remove cholesterol from your arteries. Having high blood pressure . If your blood pressure stays high over time, it can damage your heart and lead to other health problems. Having a high fasting blood sugar . Mildly high blood sugar may be an early sign of diabetes. The more factors you have, the higher your risk for heart disease, diabetes, and stroke is. What causes metabolic syndrome?

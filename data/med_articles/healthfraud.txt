Health fraud scams involve selling medicines, supplements , devices, foods, or cosmetics that have not been proven effective. At best, these scams don't work. At worst, they're dangerous. They also waste money and might keep you from getting the treatment you really need. Some of the possible dangers of scam products are that they could: Be contaminated from being made in unclean facilities or without proper quality control Contain harmful ingredients that are not listed on the label Trigger a harmful interaction with medicines you are taking Cause serious, even life-threatening, injuries Health fraud scams can be found everywhere, promising help for many common health issues, including weight loss, memory loss, sexual performance, and joint pain. They target people with serious conditions such as cancer , diabetes , heart disease , HIV , and Alzheimer's disease . Just remember - if it sounds too good to be true, it's probably a scam. Some red flags to watch for are product claims that: Have personal testimonials by "real" people or "doctors" played by actors claiming amazing results. Say that the product can treat or cure a wide range of unrelated diseases. No one product can treat or cure many different illnesses. Mention conspiracy theories like "This is the cure our government and Big Pharma don't want you to know about." Include phrases such as: Ancient remedy Miracle cure No-risk money back guarantee Natural cure Quick fix Secret ingredient Scientific breakthrough Use scientific-sounding terms that don't make sense for the products, such as "molecule multiplicity." Refer to prestigious prizes, for example "Nobel Prize winning technology." Before taking an unproven or little-known product, talk to your health care provider, especially if you are taking any prescription medicines. Food and Drug Administration

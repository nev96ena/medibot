For many people, laser eye surgery can correct their vision so they no longer need 
glasses or contact lenses.  Laser eye surgery reshapes the cornea, the clear front part of 
the eye.  This changes its focusing power. There are different types of laser eye surgery.  LASIK - laser-assisted in situ 
keratomileusis - is one of the most common. Many patients who have LASIK end up with 20/20 
vision. But, like all medical procedures, it has both risks and benefits.  Only your eye 
doctor can tell if you are a good candidate for laser eye surgery.

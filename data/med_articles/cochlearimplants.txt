A cochlear implant is a small, complex electronic device that can help to provide a sense of sound. People who are profoundly deaf or severely hard-of-hearing can get help from them. The implant consists of two parts. One part sits on the outside of the body, behind the ear.  A second part is surgically placed under the skin. An implant does not restore normal hearing.  It can help a person understand speech.  Children and adults can benefit from them. National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders

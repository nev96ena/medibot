Your jaw is a set of bones that holds your teeth. It includes: The maxilla, which is the upper part of your jaw. It holds your top teeth in place and doesn't move. It also supports the muscles involved in chewing and facial expressions. The mandible, which is the lower part of your jaw. You move it when you talk or chew. It also holds your lower teeth in place. The temporomandibular joints (TMJs), which are two joints (one on each side) that connect your mandible to your skull. Jaw problems can include: Fractures (broken bones). Dislocations , which are joint injuries that force the ends of your bones out of position. Temporomandibular disorders (TMDs), which are conditions that affect your TMJs. Osteonecrosis , which happens when the blood flow to part of your bone is disrupted. It can cause the bone to break down. Jaw tumors, which can be benign (not cancer) or cancer. Jaw defects, which are birth defects in which your jaw could be missing or deformed. Diagnostic imaging tests are often used to diagnose jaw injuries and disorders. Your treatment will depend on which jaw problem you have.

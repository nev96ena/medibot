Electric and magnetic fields (EMFs), also called radiation , are areas of energy that surround electrical devices. Everyday sources of EMFs include: Power lines Electrical wiring Microwave ovens Computers Cell phones Some people worry about EMF exposure and cancer. Some studies have found a link between EMF exposure and a higher risk of childhood leukemia, but other studies have not. Other studies have not found proof that EMF exposure causes other childhood cancers. Studies in adults did not prove that EMF exposure causes cancer. Some people worry that cell (wireless) phones cause cancer or other health problems. The phones do give off radiofrequency energy (RF), a form of electromagnetic radiation.  So far, scientific evidence has not found a link between cell phone use and health problems in humans. However, scientists need to do more research on this before they can say for sure. If you are worried about avoiding any possible risks, you can limit your exposure by: Reducing the amount of time you spend using your cell phone Use speaker mode or a headset to place more distance between your head and the cell phone NIH: National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences

Endoscopy is a procedure that lets your doctor look inside your body. It uses an instrument called an endoscope, or scope for short.  Scopes have a tiny camera attached to a long, thin tube. The doctor moves it through a body passageway or opening to see inside an organ. Sometimes scopes are used for surgery, such as for removing polyps from the colon.

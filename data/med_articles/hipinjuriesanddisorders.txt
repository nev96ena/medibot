Your hip is the joint where your femur (thigh bone) meets your pelvis (hip bone). There are two main parts: a ball at the end of the femur, which fits in a socket in the pelvis. Your hip is known as a ball-and-socket joint. This is because you have a ball at the end of your femur, and it fits into a socket in your pelvis. This makes your hips very stable and allows for a wide range of motion. When they are healthy, it takes great force to hurt them. However, playing sports, running, overuse, or falling can sometimes lead to hip injuries such as: Strains Bursitis Dislocations Fractures (broken bones) Certain diseases also lead to hip injuries or problems. Osteoarthritis can cause pain 
and limited motion. Osteoporosis of the hip causes weak bones that break easily. Both of 
these are common in older people. Another problem is hip dysplasia, where the ball at the end of the femur is loose in the hip socket. It can cause hip dislocation. Babies who have hip dysplasia are usually born with it, but sometimes they develop it later. Treatment for hip disorders may include rest, medicines, physical therapy, or surgery, including hip replacement .

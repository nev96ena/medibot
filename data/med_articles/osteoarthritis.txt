What is osteoarthritis? Osteoarthritis, sometimes called OA, is a type of arthritis that only affects the joints, usually in the hands, knees, hips, neck, and lower back. It's the most common type of arthritis. In a healthy joint, the ends of the bones are covered with a smooth, slippery tissue called cartilage. The cartilage pads the bones and helps them glide easily when you move the joint. With osteoarthritis, the cartilage breaks down and becomes rough. Sometimes, all the cartilage wears away and the bones rub together. Bumps of extra bone called bone spurs may grow in the joint area. There is no cure for osteoarthritis. It usually gets worse slowly. But there's a lot you can do to manage the symptoms. What are the symptoms of osteoarthritis? Osteoarthritis affects people in different ways, and not everyone has pain. The most common symptoms are: Pain when you move, which often gets better with rest Stiffness, especially for the first 30 minutes after you get up from resting Swollen joints, especially after using the joint a lot Less movement in the joint than normal A joint that feels loose or unstable What causes osteoarthritis?

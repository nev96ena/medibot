Sexually transmitted infections (STIs), or sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), are caused by bacteria , viruses , and parasites that spread from person to person, usually during vaginal, oral, or anal sex. Some STIs are spread by skin-to-skin contact. Without treatment, some STIs can cause long-term health problems. There are more than 20 types of STIs, including: Chlamydia Genital herpes Gonorrhea HIV HPV (human papillomavirus) Pubic lice Syphilis Trichomoniasis STIs don't always cause symptoms. So it is possible to have an infection without knowing it and then pass it on to someone else. The only way to know for sure whether you have an STI is to get tested . How can I reduce my chances of getting a sexually transmitted infection (STI)? The most reliable way to avoid infection is to not have vaginal, oral, or anal sex. Saying "no" to sex is the right choice for many teens. If you decide to have sex, "safer sex" practices will lower your chance of getting an STI. They include: Talking with your partner about preventing STIs and getting tested before having sex. If you can't talk about STIs, you aren't ready to have sex. Getting the HPV vaccine. You can be vaccinated between ages 9 and 26. Using condoms correctly every time you have vaginal, oral, or anal sex: External (male) latex condoms provide the best protection against STIs. If you or your partner is allergic to latex , you can use polyurethane condoms. Internal (female) condoms, made of nitrile, are placed inside the body (vagina or anus). They may be less effective against STIs than latex external condoms. Don't use both type of condoms together because that increases the chance they'll rip Use a dental dam (a square piece of latex, polyurethane, or nitrile) to protect the mouth during oral sex Having sex with only one person who has sex only with you (mutual monogamy). But first, both of you should get tested for STIs. Not mixing alcohol or drugs with sex. You need to think clearly to make safer choices about sex. How can I reduce the chance of pregnancy? The only sure way to avoid pregnancy is not to have vaginal sex. If you decide to have vaginal sex, birth control can help prevent pregnancy. There are many types of birth control that work in different ways.  Your health care provider can help you choose birth control that's best for you. Condoms are the only birth control method that protects against STIs. But condoms alone aren't the most effective form of birth control. It's safest to use condoms with another form of birth control to prevent both STIs and pregnancy. What is a healthy relationship? Healthy sex starts with a healthy relationship, so it's important to take an honest look at how you and your partner treat each other. Your relationship may be healthy if it includes: Respect.

Giant cell arteritis is a disorder that causes inflammation of your arteries, usually in the scalp, neck, and arms. It narrows the arteries, which keeps blood from flowing well. Giant cell arteritis often occurs with another disorder called polymyalgia rheumatica . Both are more common in women than in men. They almost always affect people over the age of 50. Early symptoms of giant cell arteritis resemble the flu:  fatigue, loss of appetite, and fever. Other symptoms include: Headaches Pain and tenderness over the temples Double vision or visual loss, dizziness Problems with coordination and balance Pain in your jaw and tongue Your doctor will make the diagnosis based on your medical history, symptoms, and a physical exam. There is no specific test for giant cell arteritis, but you may have tests that measure inflammation. Treatment is usually with corticosteroids . Early treatment is important; otherwise there is a risk of permanent vision loss or stroke.  However, when properly treated, giant cell arteritis rarely comes back.

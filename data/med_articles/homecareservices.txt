Home care is care that allows a person with special needs to stay in their home. It might be for people who are getting older (aging in place). It could also be for people who are chronically ill, recovering from surgery, or have a disability . Home care services include: Personal care, such as help with bathing, washing your hair, or getting dressed Household chores, such as cleaning, yard work, and laundry Cooking for you in your home or delivering meals to you Money management, such as help filling out forms and making sure that your bills are paid on time Health care, such as having a home health aide come to your home or getting care from your provider through telehealth You can get almost any type of help you want in your home. You have to pay for many of them. But some types of care and community services are free or donated. Sometimes government programs or your health insurance will help cover the cost of certain home care services. NIH: National Institute on Aging

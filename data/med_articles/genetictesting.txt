What is genetic testing? Genetic testing is a type of medical test that looks for changes in your DNA. DNA is short for deoxyribonucleic acid. It contains the genetic instructions in all living things. Genetic tests analyze your cells or tissue to look for any changes in: Genes , which are parts of DNA that carry the information needed to make a protein Chromosomes , which are thread-like structures in your cells. They contain DNA and proteins. Proteins , which do most of the work in your cells.  Testing can look for changes in the amount and activity level of proteins. If it finds changes, it might be due to changes in your DNA. Why is genetic testing done? Genetic testing may be done for many different reasons, including to: Find genetic diseases in unborn babies.

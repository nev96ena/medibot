Viral tests can either be rapid tests or laboratory tests: Rapid tests can be done in minutes. They are often antigen tests, which look for specific proteins from the virus. Some rapid tests are self-tests which you can do at home. Laboratory tests can take days to complete and include PCR tests . An antibody (serology) test might tell you if you had a past infection. If you need a COVID-19 test, you can: Buy a self-test online or at a store. Make sure that the test you buy has been authorized by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Check your state or local health department's website for information on testing in your area. Contact your health care provider.
